            <p>
              Welcome to the Department of Computer Science &amp; Information Systems. When students ask me what
              makes Caldwell different, I tell them the truth: we don’t just teach computer science, we practice
              it alongside our students, every semester.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our faculty are researchers and former industry engineers first — people who have shipped real
              systems and know what a technical interview actually asks. That experience shapes every course we
              teach, from introductory programming to our senior capstone studio, where teams build working
              software for outside clients instead of writing another toy assignment.
            </p>
            <p>
              It also shows up outside the classroom. Our hackathon and competitive programming teams train
              year-round, and it shows — this year our students placed ahead of teams from schools many times
              our size, including several Ivy League programs, at regional hackathons and case competitions.
              That is not an accident. It is what happens when small class sizes, faculty who are still active
              practitioners, and students who are hungry to build come together.
            </p>
            <p>
              Whether you are a prospective student, a parent, or a future employer, I invite you to see it for
              yourself. Come to an open house, sit in on a class, or talk to our students directly. I think
              you’ll leave convinced, the way I was.
            </p>
